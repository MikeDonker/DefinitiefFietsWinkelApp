# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the React + Vite application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Dependencies
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` package (version 1.1.0)
- Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

### 2. Modified Files
- **src/App.tsx**: 
  - Added `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react';` at the top
  - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the main App component, nested within the `TooltipProvider` and after the `BrowserRouter`

## Implementation Details

The SpeedInsights component was added following the official Vercel documentation for React applications (create-react-app style). The component is placed at the root level of the application to ensure it tracks all routes and pages.

**Location in component tree:**
```
<ErrorBoundary>
  <QueryClientProvider>
    <TooltipProvider>
      <Toaster />
      <Sonner />
      <BrowserRouter>
        <Routes>...</Routes>
      </BrowserRouter>
      <SpeedInsights /> ← Added here
    </TooltipProvider>
  </QueryClientProvider>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## Verification

✅ **Build**: Successfully compiled with no errors
✅ **Lint**: No new errors or warnings introduced
✅ **Package Manager**: Updated package-lock.json with npm

## Next Steps

After deployment to Vercel:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Speed Insights tab → Enable)
2. The `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` route will be available after deployment
3. Performance metrics will start being collected automatically
4. Data will be viewable in the Vercel dashboard after users visit the site

## Notes

- This implementation uses `@vercel/speed-insights/react` which is appropriate for React applications with Vite
- The component is placed at the root level to track all routes managed by React Router
- No additional configuration is needed; Speed Insights will work automatically once deployed to Vercel
